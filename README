Tip:
After adding a file, or something to a file and it's not defined, check if you included the header file that contains the initialization



Adding a .cc file:

Add your .cc file to directory
Add the file to makefile SRCS and one above clean
Copy format of above file with your file name
Add necessary header files
(Makefiles make compilation much easier. Just Type make to compile and dice to run)



Adding a global variable:

Add variable as extern in globals.h
Declare it again as you would a global variable in ONE file
Use it as normal
(This allows global variables to exist without being defined so as to not be defined multiple times and all files can use it)



Adding a function:

Add function to folder
Add function to prototypes.h
(Prototyping is necessary for clean code. This is just how you do it with multiple files)
